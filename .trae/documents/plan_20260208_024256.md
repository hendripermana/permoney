I will continue the UI/UX overhaul by systematically refactoring the remaining views and forms to use the new design system, ensuring consistent application of the modern, minimalist design across the entire application.

### Phase 1: Form Refactoring
I will update the following form partials to use the new `section-card` and `section-grid` utility classes, replacing legacy spacing and background classes:
- **Transactions**: `app/views/transactions/_form.html.erb`
- **Transfers**: `app/views/transfers/_form.html.erb`
- **Categories**: `app/views/categories/_form.html.erb`
- **Loans**: `app/views/loans/_form.html.erb`, `_enhanced_form.html.erb`, `new_borrowing.html.erb`, `new_payment.html.erb`
- **Services & Subscriptions**: `app/views/services/_form.html.erb`, `app/views/subscription_plans/_form.html.erb`
- **Others**: `family_merchants/_form.html.erb`, `rules/_form.html.erb`, `tags/_form.html.erb`

### Phase 2: Page Layout Refactoring
I will update main page layouts to use the responsive grid system:
- **Reports**: `app/views/reports/index.html.erb`
- **Settings**: `app/views/settings/provider_directories/index.html.erb`
- **Merchants**: `app/views/family_merchants/index.html.erb`
- **Services**: `app/views/services/index.html.erb`

### Phase 3: SVG & Icon Standardization
I will search for raw `<svg>` usage and replace them with the enhanced `icon` helper to ensure:
- Consistent sizing and coloring.
- Automatic application of the new `transition-all duration-300` animation class.
- Proper dark mode support.

### Phase 4: Style Guide Enhancement (Before/After Demo)
To satisfy the "interactive demo showing transformation before-after" requirement, I will add a new section to the Style Guide (`/styleguide`) that explicitly renders:
1.  A "Legacy" component (recreated using the old ad-hoc classes).
2.  The "Modern" equivalent (using the new tokens).
3.  A toggle or side-by-side view to visualize the improvement in contrast, spacing, and interaction.

### Phase 5: Verification
- Verify the build to ensure no syntax errors.
- Confirm the `theme_controller.js` is correctly initialized in the layout.
