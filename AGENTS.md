This document provides comprehensive guidance for AI agents working on the Permoney codebase. It combines essential development patterns, architectural decisions, and best practices.

## Project Overview

Permoney is a personal finance application built with Ruby on Rails that helps users track net worth, manage budgets, and gain financial insights. The application supports both managed hosting and self-hosted deployments.

### Application Modes
- **Managed**: Permoney team operates servers for users (`Rails.application.config.app_mode = "managed"`)
- **Self Hosted**: Users host on their own infrastructure via Docker Compose (`Rails.application.config.app_mode = "self_hosted"`)

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- **Code**: `app/` (Rails MVC, services, jobs, mailers, components), JS in `app/javascript/`, styles/assets in `app/assets/` (Tailwind, images, fonts)
- **Config**: `config/`, environment examples in `.env.local.example` and `.env.test.example`
- **Data**: `db/` (migrations, seeds), fixtures in `test/fixtures/`
- **Tests**: `test/` mirroring `app/` structure (e.g., `test/models/*_test.rb`)
- **Tooling**: `bin/` (project scripts), `docs/` (guides), `public/` (static), `lib/` (shared libs)
- **Components**: `app/components/` (ViewComponents with co-located Stimulus controllers)

## Core Domain Model

The application is built around financial data management with these key relationships:
- **User** ‚Üí has many **Accounts** ‚Üí has many **Transactions**
- **Family**: Top-level entity containing users, accounts, and preferences
- **Account** types: checking, savings, credit cards, investments, crypto, loans, properties, personal lending
- **Transaction** ‚Üí belongs to **Category**, can have **Tags** and **Rules**
- **Investment accounts** ‚Üí have **Holdings** ‚Üí track **Securities** via **Trades**
- **Entry**: Base class for transactions, valuations, and trades that modify account balances
- **Balance**: Daily balance snapshots for accounts

### Account Classifications
**Assets**: Depository, Investment, Crypto, Property, Vehicle, Other Asset
**Liabilities**: Credit Card, Loan (Person and Institute), Pay Later/BNPL, Personal Lending (borrowing), Other Liability

### Indonesian Finance Features
- **Islamic Finance**: Sharia-compliant loans, credit cards, transaction types (Zakat, Infaq/Sadaqah)
- **Personal Lending**: Qard Hasan, informal lending with tracking and reminders
- **Fintech Integration**: Pinjol, P2P Lending, PayLater services
- **Local Categories**: Arisan, Indonesian-specific expense categories

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- **Setup**: `cp .env.local.example .env.local && bin/setup` ‚Äî install deps, set DB, prepare app
- **Run app**: `bin/dev` ‚Äî starts Rails server and asset/watchers via `Procfile.dev`
- **Test suite**: `bin/rails test` ‚Äî run all Minitest tests; add `TEST=test/models/user_test.rb` to target a file
- **Lint Ruby**: `bin/rubocop` ‚Äî style checks; add `-A` to auto-correct safe cops
- **Lint/format JS/CSS**: `npm run lint` and `npm run format` ‚Äî uses Biome
- **Security scan**: `bin/brakeman` ‚Äî static analysis for common Rails issues

### Pre-Pull Request CI Workflow
**ALWAYS run these commands before opening a pull request:**
1. **Tests** (Required): `bin/rails test` ‚Äî Run all tests (always required)
2. **Linting** (Required): `bin/rubocop -f github -a` ‚Äî Ruby linting with auto-correct
3. **Security** (Required): `bin/brakeman --no-pager` ‚Äî Security analysis

Only proceed with pull request creation if ALL checks pass.

## General Development Rules

### Authentication Context
- **Use `Current.user` for the current user. DO NOT use `current_user`**
- **Use `Current.family` for the current family. DO NOT use `current_family`**

### Development Guidelines
- Prior to generating any code, carefully read the project conventions and guidelines
- Ignore i18n methods and files. Hardcode strings in English for now to optimize speed of development
- Do not run `rails server` in your responses
- Do not run `touch tmp/restart.txt`
- Do not run `rails credentials`
- Do not automatically run migrations

### Key Conventions
1. **Minimize Dependencies**: Push Rails to its limits before adding new dependencies
2. **Skinny Controllers, Fat Models**: Business logic in `app/models/`, avoid `app/services/`
3. **Hotwire-First Frontend**: Native HTML preferred over JS components
4. **Optimize for Simplicity**: Prioritize good OOP domain design over performance
5. **Database vs ActiveRecord Validations**: Simple validations in DB, complex logic in ActiveRecord

## Assets, Importmap, and Controllers
- **Asset pipeline**: Propshaft with Importmap (no bundler). Assets are served from:
  - `app/assets/builds` for Tailwind output (`tailwind.css`)
  - `app/javascript` for app code and Stimulus controllers
  - `vendor/javascript` for third‚Äëparty ESM files
- **Controller loading**:
  - We pin `@hotwired/stimulus-loading` to a local shim at `app/javascript/stimulus-loading.js` via `config/importmap.rb`
  - `app/javascript/controllers/index.js` eager‚Äëloads controllers under the `controllers/*` importmap namespace
- **After adding controllers or vendor JS**, restart `bin/dev` and consider `bin/rails tmp:cache:clear` if digests look stale

## TailwindCSS Design System

### Design System Rules
- **Always reference `app/assets/tailwind/permoney-design-system.css`** for primitives and tokens
- **Use functional tokens** defined in design system:
  - `text-primary` instead of `text-white`
  - `bg-container` instead of `bg-white`
  - `border border-primary` instead of `border border-gray-200`
- **NEVER create new styles** in design system files without permission
- **Always generate semantic HTML**
- **Always use `icon` helper** in `application_helper.rb`, NEVER `lucide_icon` directly

## Component Architecture

### ViewComponent vs Partials Decision Making
**Use ViewComponents when:**
- Element has complex logic or styling patterns
- Element will be reused across multiple views/contexts
- Element needs structured styling with variants/sizes
- Element requires interactive behavior or Stimulus controllers
- Element has configurable slots or complex APIs
- Element needs accessibility features or ARIA support

**Use Partials when:**
- Element is primarily static HTML with minimal logic
- Element is used in only one or few specific contexts
- Element is simple template content
- Element doesn't need variants, sizes, or complex configuration
- Element is more about content organization than reusable functionality

### Stimulus Controller Guidelines
**Declarative Actions (Required):**
```erb
<!-- GOOD: Declarative - HTML declares what happens -->
<div data-controller="toggle">
  <button data-action="click->toggle#toggle" data-toggle-target="button">Show</button>
  <div data-toggle-target="content" class="hidden">Hello World!</div>
</div>
```

**Controller Best Practices:**
- Keep controllers lightweight and simple (< 7 targets)
- Use private methods and expose clear public API
- Single responsibility or highly related responsibilities
- Component controllers stay in component directory, global controllers in `app/javascript/controllers/`
- Pass data via `data-*-value` attributes, not inline JavaScript

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- **Ruby**: 2-space indent, `snake_case` for methods/vars, `CamelCase` for classes/modules. Follow Rails conventions for folders and file names
- **Views**: ERB checked by `erb-lint` (see `.erb_lint.yml`). Avoid heavy logic in views; prefer helpers/components
- **JavaScript**: `lowerCamelCase` for vars/functions, `PascalCase` for classes/components. Let Biome format code
- **Commit**: Small, cohesive changes; keep diffs focused

## Testing Philosophy

### General Testing Rules
- **ALWAYS use Minitest + fixtures** (NEVER RSpec or factories)
- Keep fixtures minimal (2-3 per model for base cases)
- Create edge cases on-the-fly within test context
- Use Rails helpers for large fixture creation needs

### Test Quality Guidelines
- **Write minimal, effective tests** - system tests sparingly
- **Only test critical and important code paths**
- **Test boundaries correctly:**
  - Commands: test they were called with correct params
  - Queries: test output
  - Don't test implementation details of other classes

### Testing Examples
```ruby
# GOOD - Testing critical domain business logic
test "syncs balances" do
  Holding::Syncer.any_instance.expects(:sync_holdings).returns([]).once
  assert_difference "@account.balances.count", 2 do
    Balance::Syncer.new(@account, strategy: :forward).sync_balances
  end
end

# BAD - Testing ActiveRecord functionality
test "saves balance" do 
  balance_record = Balance.new(balance: 100, currency: "USD")
  assert balance_record.save
end
```

### Stubs and Mocks
- Use `mocha` gem
- Prefer `OpenStruct` for mock instances
- Only mock what's necessary

### Test Structure
- **Framework**: Minitest (Rails). Name files `*_test.rb` and mirror `app/` structure
- **Run**: `bin/rails test` locally and ensure green before pushing
- **Fixtures/VCR**: Use `test/fixtures` and existing VCR cassettes for HTTP. Prefer unit tests plus focused integration tests

## Background Processing

Sidekiq handles asynchronous tasks:
- **Account syncing** (`SyncAccountsJob`)
- **Import processing** (`ImportDataJob`)
- **AI chat responses** (`CreateChatResponseJob`)
- **Scheduled maintenance** via sidekiq-cron
- **Market data imports** (`ImportMarketDataJob`)

### Job Configuration
- **Queues**: `scheduled`, `high_priority`, `medium_priority`, `low_priority`, `default`
- **Cron jobs**: Defined in `config/schedule.yml`
- **Redis**: Required for Sidekiq operation
- **Monitoring**: Available at `/sidekiq` (production auth required)

## API Architecture

The application provides both internal and external APIs:
- **Internal API**: Controllers serve JSON via Turbo for SPA-like interactions
- **External API**: `/api/v1/` namespace with Doorkeeper OAuth and API key authentication
- **API responses**: Use Jbuilder templates for JSON rendering
- **Rate limiting**: Via Rack Attack with configurable limits per API key
- **Authentication**: Session-based for web, OAuth2/API keys for external access

### API Development Guidelines
- Inherit from `Api::V1::BaseController`
- Use `authorize_scope!("read"|"write")` for permissions
- Respect API key rate limiting headers
- Force JSON responses
- Add comprehensive tests under `test/controllers/api/v1/`

## External Services Integration

### Plaid Integration
- **Bank account syncing**: Real-time transaction and balance updates
- **Transaction import**: Automatic categorization and processing
- **PlaidItem**: Manages connections and sync operations
- **Background jobs**: Handle data updates asynchronously

### OpenAI Integration
- **AI chat functionality**: Financial Q&A and insights
- **Transaction categorization**: Automatic expense/income classification
- **Financial insights**: Spending analysis and recommendations
- **Assistant functions**: Structured data queries (balance sheet, income statement)

### Stripe Integration
- **Subscription management**: Billing for managed hosting
- **Payment processing**: Secure payment handling
- **Webhook handling**: Real-time subscription updates

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Ruby on Rails 7
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with UUID primary keys
- **Frontend**: Hotwire (Turbo + Stimulus)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS v4 with custom design system
- **Testing**: Minitest + fixtures
- **Jobs**: Sidekiq + Redis
- **External APIs**: Plaid, OpenAI, Stripe
- **Deployment**: Docker support for self-hosting

## Sync & Import System

Two primary data ingestion methods:
1. **Plaid Integration**: Real-time bank account syncing
   - `PlaidItem` manages connections
   - `Sync` tracks sync operations
   - Background jobs handle data updates
2. **CSV Import**: Manual data import with mapping
   - `Import` manages import sessions
   - Supports transaction and balance imports
   - Custom field mapping with transformation rules

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- **Commits**: Imperative subject ‚â§ 72 chars (e.g., "Add account balance validation"). Include rationale in body and reference issues (`#123`)
- **PRs**: Clear description, linked issues, screenshots for UI changes, and migration notes if applicable. Ensure CI passes, tests added/updated, and `rubocop`/Biome are clean

## Security & Authentication

### Security Best Practices
- **Never commit secrets**: Use `.env.local` for development, environment variables for production
- **Session-based auth**: For web users with CSRF protection
- **API authentication**: OAuth2 (Doorkeeper) for third-party apps, API keys with JWT for direct access
- **Scoped permissions**: System for API access control
- **Strong parameters**: Throughout application with CSRF protection
- **Security scanning**: Run `bin/brakeman` before major PRs

### Multi-Currency Support
- All monetary values stored in base currency (user's primary currency)
- `Money` objects handle currency conversion and formatting
- Historical exchange rates for accurate reporting
- Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) support with proper formatting

## Performance Considerations

- **Database queries**: Optimized with proper indexes
- **N+1 queries**: Prevented via includes/joins
- **Background jobs**: For heavy operations
- **Caching strategies**: For expensive calculations
- **Turbo Frames**: For partial page updates
- **Focus performance**: Only on critical/global areas

## Common Patterns

### Account Balance Calculation
```ruby
# Daily balances calculated from entries
account.balances.order(:date)

# Current balance
account.current_balance

# Balance on specific date
account.balance_on(date)
```

### Entry Management
```ruby
# Create transaction
account.transactions.create!(
  amount: -100, # Negative for expense
  currency: "USD",
  date: Date.current
)

# Create transfer
Transfer.create!(
  from_account: checking,
  to_account: savings,
  amount: 500
)
```

### Family Management
```ruby
# Current family context
Current.family

# Family members
family.users

# Family accounts
family.accounts
```

### Indonesian Finance Examples
```ruby
# Islamic finance transaction
transaction.update!(kind: "zakat_payment", is_sharia_compliant: true)

# Personal lending
personal_lending = PersonalLending.create!(
  counterparty_name: "Ahmad",
  lending_direction: "lending_out",
  lending_type: "qard_hasan",
  relationship: "friend"
)

# Pinjol loan
loan = Loan.create!(
  compliance_type: "conventional",
  fintech_type: "pinjol",
  counterparty_name: "Kredivo"
)
```

## Documentation Guidelines
- **DO NOT create new .md files** after completing tasks unless explicitly requested by the user
- **Update existing documentation** when your changes affect existing features or configurations
- **Only create documentation** when:
  - User explicitly requests new documentation
  - Adding entirely new features that require user guidance
  - Creating API documentation for new endpoints
- **Preferred approach**: Update existing files in `docs/`, `README.md`, or inline code comments
- **Avoid**: Creating summary reports, completion reports, or task-specific .md files

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Asset 404s**: Clear cache with `bin/rails tmp:cache:clear`
2. **Database issues**: Check `config/database.yml`
3. **Importmap issues**: Restart `bin/dev`
4. **Test failures**: Check fixtures and test data
5. **Redis issues**: Ensure Redis is running for Sidekiq

### Debugging
- Use `Rails.logger.debug` for logging
- Check `log/development.log`
- Use `binding.pry` for debugging
- Monitor Sidekiq dashboard for job issues
- VCR cassettes for external API testing

## Notes for AI Agents

When working on this codebase:

1. **Always check existing patterns** before implementing new features
2. **Use the design system** (`app/assets/tailwind/permoney-design-system.css`) for styling
3. **Follow Rails conventions** for file organization
4. **Write tests** for new functionality using Minitest + fixtures
5. **Update documentation** when adding features (update existing files, don't create new ones)
6. **Consider both managed and self-hosted modes** in your implementations
7. **Respect the AGPLv3 license** and attribution requirements
8. **Use `Current.user` and `Current.family`** instead of `current_user`/`current_family`
9. **Prioritize Indonesian finance features** when relevant (Islamic finance, personal lending, local categories)
10. **Always use `icon` helper** instead of `lucide_icon` directly
11. **Keep controllers skinny** - business logic belongs in models
12. **Use ViewComponents** for complex UI, partials for simple content
13. **Prefer semantic HTML** over custom JavaScript components
14. **Test critical paths only** - don't test ActiveRecord functionality
15. **Run pre-PR checks**: tests, linting, security scan

### Quick Reference Commands
```bash
# Setup and run
cp .env.local.example .env.local && bin/setup
bin/dev

# Testing and quality

- **Islamic compliance** is important (Sharia vs conventional)
- **Personal lending** is common (family, friends, informal agreements)
- **Fintech integration** (Pinjol, P2P lending, e-wallets)
- **Cultural sensitivity** in reminders and communications
- **Local categories** (Arisan, Zakat, Infaq/Sadaqah)
- **Multi-currency support** with IDR formatting
