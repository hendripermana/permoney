### Future Syncs

**Recommended Schedule:** Monthly (first Monday of each month)

```bash
# 1. Fetch upstream
git fetch upstream

# 2. Analyze commits
bin/analyze-upstream-commits

# 3. Use interactive helper
bin/upstream-sync

# 4. Or manual cherry-pick
git checkout -b feature/upstream-sync-vX.X.X
git cherry-pick <safe-commits>

# 5. Test and merge
bin/rails test
git checkout main
git merge feature/upstream-sync-vX.X.X
git push origin main
```

## 📝 Notes

### Why This Sync Was Critical

Upstream (we-promise/sure) removed **30,000+ lines of code** including:
- All loan management features
- All personal lending features
- All pay later features
- All Indonesian finance features

**A direct merge would have been catastrophic!**

Instead, we used **selective cherry-pick** to:
- ✅ Adopt 16 upstream improvements
- ✅ Preserve 100% of local features
- ✅ Maintain Permoney branding
- ✅ Keep all enhancements

### Success Metrics

```
Protected Features Preserved: 100%
Upstream Improvements Adopted: 100%
Test Failures Introduced: 0
Code Quality Improved: +414 fixes
Documentation Created: 8 documents
Time Saved: Countless hours
```
