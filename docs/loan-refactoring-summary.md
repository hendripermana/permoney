# Loan Feature Refactoring Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive refactoring of the Loan feature to align with the system's architectural conventions and best practices. The refactoring addresses several anti-patterns and introduces a more maintainable, Rails-idiomatic approach.

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Service Object Anti-pattern
**Problem**: Heavy reliance on service objects (`Loan::PaymentService`, `Loan::PostInstallment`, etc.) violated the system's preference for "POROs and concerns over service objects."

**Solution**: Consolidated business logic into model concerns (`Loan::Payable`, `Loan::Providable`).

### 2. Business Logic Misplacement
**Problem**: Core loan logic scattered across services instead of being in model concerns per guidelines.

**Solution**: Moved payment, borrowing, and installment logic directly into the Loan model via concerns.

### 3. Non-RESTful Controller Design
**Problem**: Controller cluttered with custom actions (`new_borrowing`, `create_borrowing`, etc.).

**Solution**: Simplified controller to use concern-based methods, maintaining REST principles while delegating to model methods.

### 4. Over-engineered Forms
**Problem**: Complex ERB partials with heavy JavaScript dependencies.

**Solution**: Created `Loan::FormComponent` ViewComponent with helper-driven, configurable approach.

### 5. Hardcoded Values
**Problem**: Forms and controllers contained hardcoded strings and magic values.

**Solution**: Moved all configuration to helpers and i18n files, making everything configurable.

## New Architecture

### Model Layer (`app/models/`)

#### `Loan::Payable` Concern
- **Purpose**: Handles all payment-related operations
- **Methods**:
  - `make_payment()` - Process loan payments
  - `post_installment()` - Post scheduled installments
  - `borrow_more()` - Handle additional borrowing
  - `apply_extra_payment()` - Process extra principal payments
  - `rebuild_schedule!()` - Regenerate payment schedule

#### `Loan::Providable` Concern
- **Purpose**: Integrates with Provider::Registry for external data
- **Features**:
  - Market interest rate comparisons
  - Institution details lookup
  - Islamic finance compliance verification
  - Rate validation against market data

### Controller Layer (`app/controllers/`)

#### Simplified `LoansController`
- **Approach**: Uses model concerns instead of services
- **Pattern**: Standard Rails error handling with try/catch blocks
- **Methods**: Delegate to model methods, handle responses consistently

### View Layer (`app/components/`)

#### `Loan::FormComponent`
- **Architecture**: ViewComponent with helper delegation
- **Configuration**: All field configs driven by `LoanFormHelper`
- **Styling**: Uses design system components (`DS::Link`, etc.)
- **Localization**: All strings externalized to i18n files

### Helper Layer (`app/helpers/`)

#### `LoanFormHelper`
- **Purpose**: Centralizes form configuration and business logic
- **Features**:
  - Dynamic field configuration
  - Option builders for selects
  - Validation helpers
  - Stimulus data generation
  - Path helpers

### JavaScript Layer (`app/javascript/controllers/`)

#### Simplified `loan_form_controller.js`
- **Approach**: Lightweight, declarative Stimulus controller
- **Features**: 
  - Debounced preview updates
  - Form validation
  - Visibility toggling
  - Modal management
- **Principles**: Follows system's preference for native HTML elements

## Configuration-Driven Approach

### Field Configuration
```ruby
# All field configs centralized in helpers
def field_configurations
  {
    counterparty_name: {
      label: t("loans.form.counterparty_name.label"),
      placeholder: t("loans.form.counterparty_name.placeholder")
    },
    # ... more configs
  }
end
```

### Feature Flags Integration
```ruby
def loan_preview_enabled?
  Rails.application.config.respond_to?(:features) &&
    ActiveModel::Type::Boolean.new.cast(
      Rails.application.config.features&.dig(:loans, :borrowed, :enabled)
    )
end
```

### Provider Integration
```ruby
def market_interest_rates
  return {} unless defined?(Provider::Registry)
  
  provider = Provider::Registry.for(:interest_rate)
  provider&.rates_for(loan_type: subtype, currency: account.currency)
end
```

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Architectural Alignment**
- Follows Rails conventions
- Uses concerns over services
- Maintains single responsibility principle

### 2. **Maintainability**
- Centralized configuration
- Helper-driven approach
- Clear separation of concerns

### 3. **Testability**
- Concerns are easily testable in isolation
- Mocking simplified through clear boundaries
- Integration tests more reliable

### 4. **Flexibility**
- All strings configurable via i18n
- Feature flags respected throughout
- Provider integration for external data

### 5. **Performance**
- Reduced service object overhead
- More efficient database queries
- Proper use of Rails caching patterns

## Migration Path

### Phase 1: Core Concerns (Completed)
- [x] Create `Loan::Payable` concern
- [x] Create `Loan::Providable` concern  
- [x] Update Loan model to include concerns

### Phase 2: Controller Simplification (Completed)
- [x] Refactor controller to use concerns
- [x] Remove service dependencies
- [x] Implement proper error handling

### Phase 3: View Components (Completed)
- [x] Create `Loan::FormComponent`
- [x] Create `LoanFormHelper`
- [x] Externalize all strings to i18n

### Phase 4: JavaScript Simplification (Completed)
- [x] Simplify Stimulus controller
- [x] Remove complex state management
- [x] Focus on declarative interactions

### Phase 5: Testing (Completed)
- [x] Comprehensive concern tests
- [x] Integration tests for controller
- [x] Component tests for views

## Integration Points

### With Existing System
- **Current.family**: Proper scoping maintained
- **Account syncing**: Uses existing `sync_later` patterns
- **Transfer creation**: Leverages `Transfer::Creator`
- **Category resolution**: Uses `CategoryResolver` for expenses

### With Provider System
- **Rate providers**: Integrate market rate data
- **Institution data**: Bank/fintech information lookup
- **Compliance checking**: Islamic finance validation
- **Product information**: Loan product details

### With Feature Flags
- **Preview functionality**: Respects `loans.borrowed.enabled`
- **Extra payments**: Honors `loans.extra_payment`
- **Sharia compliance**: Conditional on `loans.sharia_compliance`

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Keep Rails vanilla and simple**: No unnecessary gems or complex abstractions
2. **Business logic in models**: Core logic moved to model concerns
3. **ViewComponents for complex UI**: Form component replaces complex partials
4. **Lightweight Stimulus**: Minimal JavaScript, maximum declarative approach
5. **Helper-driven configuration**: All options and configs centralized
6. **Proper i18n usage**: No hardcoded strings in components
7. **Feature flag respect**: All functionality respects system configuration

## Future Enhancements

### Provider Integrations
- Real-time interest rate feeds
- Institution API connections
- Credit score integrations
- Automated compliance checking

### Advanced Features
- Payment plan optimization
- Risk assessment integration
- Automated payment reminders
- Regulatory compliance reporting

### Performance Optimizations
- Schedule calculation caching
- Bulk installment processing
- Background payment processing
- Real-time balance updates

## Conclusion

This refactoring successfully transforms the Loan feature from a service-heavy, hardcoded implementation to a clean, Rails-idiomatic, configurable system that aligns with the project's architectural principles. The new approach is more maintainable, testable, and extensible while respecting all existing system conventions.
